The AI engineer successfully built a comprehensive finance management application from scratch, addressing multiple iterations of user feedback. Initial development focused on core features like user authentication (JWT), role-based access (admin/user), CRUD operations for financial transactions, and a basic UI. Challenges arose with UI component  for dropdowns within modals and the implementation of visual statistics, which required switching from Recharts to Chart.js and finally to native SVG for reliable rendering. Extensive work was done on implementing email verification, password recovery, and robust admin functionalities including user management and a profile section. The project progressed to deployment on a Hostinger VPS using EasyPanel, where the current work is focused on resolving dependency conflicts ( version) identified during the EasyPanel build process for the backend. The AI has meticulously guided the user through MongoDB Atlas setup and EasyPanel configuration.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a finance management application with login and role-based access (administrator and users). Each user should have their own isolated space, visible only to the admin. The application must support income, expense, and savings tracking, with the ability to modify, edit, and delete any field for these entries. Statistics and future AI integration capabilities were also requested, though the latter was deferred.

The application has been built with:
- Traditional JWT-based authentication, allowing anyone to register.
- Data isolation per user, with admin oversight.
- CRUD operations for income, expenses, and savings, with editable categories.
- A modern, attractive React frontend and a scalable FastAPI backend.
- Email verification on registration and password recovery functionality.
- Admin features including changing user passwords, enabling/disabling users, and a comprehensive admin panel.
- User profile section to change password, display name, and potentially an image.
- Functional statistics with visual graphs using native SVG.
- The application is structured for local testing and deployment on a Hostinger VPS.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React**: Frontend library for building user interfaces.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage, utilized with MongoDB Atlas for deployment.
- **JWT Authentication**: Token-based authentication for securing API endpoints.
- **aiosmtplib**: Python library for asynchronous email sending (verification, password reset).
- **Shadcn UI**: Component library for building modern and accessible UI elements.
- **Native SVG**: Used for rendering robust and reliable data visualizations on the frontend.
- **EasyPanel**: VPS hosting panel used for deploying the application.
- **Docker**: Containerization technology for packaging the backend.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture with a React frontend and a FastAPI backend.



-   ****: This is the core of the backend. It contains FastAPI routes for user authentication (register, login, password reset, email verification), CRUD operations for transactions and categories, user management endpoints for admins (change password, activate/deactivate users), and profile updates. It handles MongoDB interactions and email sending via .
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial implementation included core auth, CRUD. Later updates added email verification, password reset, admin-specific endpoints, user  status,  field.  and  were also refined for production. A missing root endpoint was re-added. SMTP configuration and SSL handling were improved.
-   ****: Stores critical environment variables like , , , SMTP credentials (, , , , ), , and .
    -   **Changes Made**: Initially contained , , . Later updated to include , all  variables, , and .  was updated multiple times.
-   ****: Created to define the Docker image for the FastAPI backend, simplifying deployment on platforms like EasyPanel.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created file to enable Docker-based deployment.
-   ****: Defines the main React application and sets up the routing for different pages.
    -   **Changes Made**: Initial routes were for , , , , . Later updated to include , , , , and  routes.
-   ****: Handles user login and registration.
    -   **Changes Made**: Added Forgot password link, integrated email verification messaging, and implemented the password visibility toggle (eye icon).
-   ****: Displays financial statistics, including summary cards and visual graphs.
    -   **Changes Made**: Rewritten multiple times. Initially, it used Recharts, then Chart.js, and finally native SVG for reliable graph rendering due to persistent issues with third-party libraries. This file now contains the logic for fetching financial data and rendering it using custom SVG components for bar and pie charts.
-   ****: Provides the common layout structure for the application, including navigation.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated to conditionally show the Admin Panel link for admin users and replaced the username display with a Profile button. An admin Shield icon was added.
-   ****: Dedicated page for admin users to manage other users (e.g., change passwords, enable/disable accounts).
    -   **Changes Made**: Rewritten to incorporate functionalities for changing user passwords and toggling user activation status.
-   ****: New page created for users to manage their own profile details, such as changing their display name, password, and potentially an image.
    -   **Changes Made**: Newly created file.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was guiding the user through the deployment of the FastAPI backend on a Hostinger VPS using EasyPanel. The user provided an error message indicating a build failure within EasyPanel, specifically: ¡Ah! Veo el error. El problema es con **numpy==2.3.4** que no existe esa versión. El tiene versiones incompatibles. This means the  file in the GitHub repository, which EasyPanel uses to install Python dependencies, specifies a version of  that does not exist or is incompatible, preventing the backend Docker image from building successfully. The AI has diagnosed the problem as a version incompatibility within  and is planning to address it by updating the file in the GitHub repository.
